# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection---Classification
Dataset Information It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
Given the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.

# Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Classification Problem

# Dataset Overview
The credit card fraud detection dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset consists of 284,807 transactions, with 492 instances of fraud, accounting for 0.172% of all transactions. This highly imbalanced dataset presents a challenging classification problem, where the goal is to identify fraudulent transactions.

# Features and Variables
The dataset comprises 30 features, including:
28 principal components (V1, V2, ..., V28) obtained through Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
'Time', representing the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset
'Amount', the transaction amount, which can be used for example-dependent cost-sensitive learning
'Class', the response variable, taking a value of 1 for fraudulent transactions and 0 otherwise

# Evaluation Metrics
Due to the class imbalance, the traditional accuracy metric is not suitable for evaluating model performance. Instead, we recommend using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) to measure model accuracy.

# Libraries and Algorithms
The following libraries and algorithms were used in this project:
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

# Best Model Performance
The best-performing model achieved an F1 score of 87.00%.

# Dataset Source
The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
